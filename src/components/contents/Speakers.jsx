              Prof. Priya Ranjan (Mâ€™1997) graduated from IIT Kharagpur (EE,
              1997) and earned his M.S. (1999) and Ph.D. (2003) in ECE from the
              University of Maryland, College Park. He was mentored in control
              theory by Prof. K.B. Dutta and nonlinear dynamics by Prof.
              Soumitro Banerjee. He joined CAIR, DRDO, under Prof. M.
              Vidyasagar, before moving to the CACSE lab at the University of
              Maryland under Prof. E.H. Abed. Supported by NSF, DARPA, and U.S.
              DoD grants, his research focused on nonlinear dynamics in network
              protocols, revealing intricate system behaviors influenced by
              delays. His work discovered a global stability limit for systems
              with arbitrary delays. Recently, he is exploring consensus
              instabilities and their TCP/IP implementation with his student,
              Parshal Chitrakar.
